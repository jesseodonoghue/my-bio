            <p>I am currently the Director of Event Technology for C4 Recovery Foundation, a non-profit that hosts educational conferences for addiction professionals across the US. I have been furloughed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the future of in-person events uncertain, I am currently enrolled in a Coding Boot Camp to build my skills and increase my chances of finding a career should my furlough not end.</p>
